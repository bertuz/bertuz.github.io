# My home page test 3
Howdy! 👋🏽
This is the source code of my presentation website [bertamini.net](https://www.bertamini.net).
I use it as a pet project in order to discover new things about frontend development mostly 🔬.

Feel free to dig and discover new things, but keep in mind it's a work in progress and you might find a lot of 
things that need to be improved, or are an in-progress test. 

## Tech stack
- Typescript 
- Next.JS
- Vercel for deployment

### Emotion CSS-in-JS
Stylelint has been used, but with a discontinued parser: https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/issues/2695

### JWT authentication and authorization
Next-Auth has been used. It's a great library, but it's not perfect.
Some caveat:
- todo (encryption private keys in place of env vars because of vercel's/github env var limits)
