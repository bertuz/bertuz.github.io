I am a digital product artisan, a Software Developer. As artisan I strive for the excellence of the product I build, love and care for.

As a part of a multidisciplinary team I pursue the technical excellence pragmatically to apply it the right time, the right way; deliver robust products and make them grow future change-proof by sharing and understanding the underlying business domain; good communication skills and trying to keep the end user feedback as a measure of success.

Talking about pragmatic things, I'm fond of DDD (Domain Driven Design) and Hexagonal Architectures to guide us into a good business knowledge, I got a thing for iterative products into a healthy real agile culture, and I touch (almost) every aspect of the software development, from back to front: call me fullstack, I've been mainly touching ES6 and its typed dialects, Kotlin and C++ lately, but I'm open to new languages if they fit the needs, the important thing are sound fundamentals :)

I graduated in Computer Science at the University Of Trento (Italy); that said I strongly believe in a Lifelong learning approach: as well as learning new techie things constantly, which I think it's a fundamental part of our job, I'm a partial-time student in Environmental Science and I compete in swimming masters from time to time :)

I cook well, I'm Italian coffee nazi (I have a coffee sommelier certificate, beware!) and, sorry guys, I do love sparkling water.
